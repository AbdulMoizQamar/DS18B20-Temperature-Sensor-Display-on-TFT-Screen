# DS18B20-Temperature-Sensor-Display-on-TFT-Screen
This project demonstrates how to read temperature data from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor using an Arduino-compatible board and display the temperature in Celsius on a TFT LCD screen. The TFT screen is controlled using the TFT_eSPI library, and the temperature sensor uses the DallasTemperature and OneWire libraries for communication.
