# DS18B20-Temperature-Sensor-Display-on-TFT-Screen
This project demonstrates how to read temperature data from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor using an Arduino-compatible board and display the temperature in Celsius on a TFT LCD screen. The TFT screen is controlled using the TFT_eSPI library, and the temperature sensor uses the DallasTemperature and OneWire libraries for communication.

Description:
This project demonstrates how to read temperature data from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor using an Arduino-compatible board and display the temperature in Celsius on a TFT LCD screen. The TFT screen is controlled using the TFT_eSPI library, and the temperature sensor uses the DallasTemperature and OneWire libraries for communication.

Features:
Reads temperature from the DS18B20 sensor.
Displays real-time temperature readings on a TFT LCD.
Uses hardware SPI for efficient TFT display communication.
Simple and clear UI with temperature updates every second.

Hardware required:
Arduino or ESP32/ESP8266 board
DS18B20 temperature sensor
TFT LCD display compatible with TFT_eSPI library
Necessary wiring components (resistors, wires)
This project is ideal for beginners looking to integrate sensors with graphical displays and learn about SPI communication and sensor interfacing.
